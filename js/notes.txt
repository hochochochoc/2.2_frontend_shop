1. add products to cart in buy()
    get the id of the product (from where)
    when blue buttons pressed execute function buy()
    locate product using id in the products array
    then include in cart array

    check if product was already added to the cart array

    if not, add it to array, add property quantity with value 1

    if yes, increase quantity by 1


ideas of how to use functions from 2.1:

...

2. Empty the cart with cleanCart()
    has to reinitialize the cart variable (= 0?)

3. Calculate total of cart
    use for loop to add up amount all the products

    function from 2.1: the reduce one probably

4. Promotions with applyPromotionsCart()
    two types:
    20% discount for 3 or more oil bottles
    30% discount for 10 or more cupcakes

    function receives the cart array
    modifies the subtotalWithDiscount if promotion applies (dynamically?)

    1. can a discount be applied?
    2. If yes, discounted price has to be saved under subtotalWithDiscount
    3. If no, no changes have to be applied


5. Show the shopping cart to the user with printCart()
    has to use object with id cartModal
    cartModal has to be modified to be dynamic...


6. Checkout form with checkout.js
    set the conditions for completing the form:
        1. all fields obligatory
        2. all fields at least 3 characters
        3. only letters for name and surname
        4. only numbers for phone number
        5. letters and numbers for password
        6. the email has to be in email format

    any field that doesn't comply has to be turned red 
    and have a message appear below
    (using a border or bootstrap??)

7. Remove things from cart with removeFromCart()
    one by one actually
    if only one is left, don't set quantity to 0, instead delete it
    update the promotions dynamically

8. Make it pretty...
